# Getting Started with OpenShift

- Learn OpenShift basics in 4 hours
- See how to use OpenShift using real-world demos
- Learn DevOps best practices for managing containers on Kubernetes

OpenShift is a Red Hat hybrid cloud product for distributing, managing and orchestrating containers based on Kubernetes and DevOps tools. Kubernetes is the current de facto standard for managing containers in corporate IT, and Red Hat has added integration with DevOps tools to make OpenShift a valuable tool that can be used for managing containers. This training will prepare DevOps staff to work with OpenShift. The training will get you started with OpenShift and show you how to organize a workflow in OpenShift, starting with source code of any application, and resulting in a managed and scalable container in OpenShift.

## What youâ€™ll learn and how you can apply it

- Understanding OpenShift
- Setting up an OpenShift test environment
- Running an application in OpenShift
- Understanding OpenShift building blocks
- Using Kubernetes Resources in OpenShift
- Using Source-to-Image to create applications
